## Portfolio Content

Core identity and contact details are centralized in [`src/data/config.ts`](src/data/config.ts). Skills, leadership experience, and selected work live in [`src/data/constants.ts`](src/data/constants.ts) and [`src/data/projects.tsx`](src/data/projects.tsx).

Other files you'll want to customize:

| File | What to change |
|---|---|
| `src/data/projects.tsx` | Your projects, screenshots, descriptions, and tech stacks |
| `src/data/constants.ts` | Skills list (name, description, icon) and work experience |
| `public/assets/` | Your images, OG image, and project screenshots |

## ⌨️ Updating the 3D Keyboard Skills

The 3D keyboard keycaps are baked into a Spline file. To update the skills displayed on the keyboard:

1. **Import** the `public/assets/skills-keyboard.spline` file into [Spline](https://spline.design/)
2. **Unhide** the keycap objects you want to edit
3. **Update** the logo images on each keycap to your new skill icons
4. **Rename** each keycap object to match the skill's `name` field in `src/data/constants.ts` (e.g. `js`, `react`, `docker`)
5. **Hide** all keycap objects again
6. **Export** the scene and overwrite `public/assets/skills-keyboard.spline`

After updating the Spline file, make sure `src/data/constants.ts` has matching entries for every skill on the keyboard:

```ts
// Each keycap object name in Spline must match a key in SKILLS
export const SKILLS: Record<SkillNames, Skill> = {
  js: { name: "js", label: "JavaScript", shortDescription: "...", ... },
  react: { name: "react", label: "React", shortDescription: "...", ... },
  // ... add/remove entries to match your keyboard
};
```

The `SkillNames` enum, `SKILLS` record, and the Spline keycap names must all stay in sync for the keyboard interactions to work correctly.

## 🔌 Realtime Features (Optional)

The portfolio supports optional realtime features powered by a **separate backend API**:

- 🖱️ **Live cursors** — See other visitors' cursors in realtime
- 👥 **Online presence** — Shows who's currently on the site
- 💬 **Chat** — Live chat between visitors

These features activate automatically when the `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL` environment variable is set. Without it, the portfolio works perfectly fine as a static site — no realtime features, no backend dependency.

> [!NOTE]
> The backend API is **not open source**. This is intentional! Too many people have cloned the portfolio and claimed they built it from scratch. The realtime server stays private to keep the live experience unique make make it standout.

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Connect the repository to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
3. Add your environment variables in the Vercel dashboard
4. Vercel handles the rest — automatic deployments on every push

Note on analytics: a deployed copy reports its own hostname once per browser (nothing else — no visitor, page, or referrer data) so I can see where the template gets used.
